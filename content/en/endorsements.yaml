      Leveraging GitOps has allowed us to  create a self-service platform for
      engineers so they can concentrate on delivering business value through
      innovation, without the full need for Platform Team assistance. The
      engineers focus on building container images and managing the testing
      of their microservices and Weave Flux handles the deployments.

      For Kubernetes, Gitops provides a simple audit trail that is invaluable
      in figuring out what has broken. Flux (and our Tidebot) give our developers a
      low-risk self-deployment option. Together, Flux and GitOps accelerate our
      innovation.
